# ECE1657 Project: Stochasitc Makrov Games for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning  

## Proposal (10 November)
- [ ] 1/2 Page  
- [ ] Should broadly highlight the research interest of Multi-Agent Learning and its growing need
- [ ] Describe the objective of the project (to explore the role of Stochastic Markov Games in MARL and various agent interactions)
- [ ] Briefly touch upon the algorithms and their differences (QMIX, VDN, COMA, IQL)
- [ ] Describe the environment setup (StarCraft II) and why is this suitable from a Game Theoretic perspective
- [ ] End up by laying out the outcomes expected (coordination must prevail, agent ineractions vary as per cost reduction, obtaining optimal strategies to defeat the enemy)
