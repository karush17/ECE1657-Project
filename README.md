# ECE1657 Project: Stochasitc Makrov Games for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning  

## Proposal (10 November)
- [ ] 1/2 Page  
- [ ] Should broadly highlight the research interest of Multi-Agent Learning and its growing need
- [ ] Describe the objective of the project (to explore the role of Stochastic Markov Games in MARL and various agent interactions)
- [ ] Briefly touch upon the algorithms and their differences (QMIX, VDN, COMA, IQL)
- [ ] Describe the environment setup (StarCraft II) and why is this suitable from a Game Theoretic perspective
- [ ] End up by laying out the outcomes expected (coordination must prevail, agent ineractions vary as per cost reduction, obtaining optimal strategies to defeat the enemy)

## Literature
- [ ] QMIX, VDN, COMA, IQL, Shimon Whiteson papers, Jakob Foerster thesis, etc. for algorithms
- [ ] MARL Review Papers, Reports, Surveys, etc. for Markov Games
- [ ] Should cover thorough background from Game Theoretic and RL perspective

## Review
- [ ] Focus should be on Stochastic Markov Games and their analytical description
- [ ] Description should cover introduction, notation, background and expressions
- [ ] Each term should be explained clearly and concisely
- [ ] Nash Equilibrium, Optimal Responses and other important results must be highlighted
